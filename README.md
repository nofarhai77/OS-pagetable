# OS-pagetable
Implementation of simulated OS code that handles a multi-level (trie-based) page table.  
Written in C as an assignment in operating-systems course (Tel Aviv University).

# Properties

Our simulated OS targets an imaginary 64-bit x86-like CPU.  
  
pt - pointer to page table (trie) by physical page number.  
vpn - virtual page number (withour offset).  
ppn - physical page number (withour offset).  

1. Virtual address structure - only the lower 57 bits are used for translation. 12 LSB is offset, 7 MSB is sign ext, leave 45 bits to vpn.
2. Physical address structure - likewise.
3. Page table structure - LSB is valid bit, bits 1â€“11 are unused and must be zero, top 52 bits contain the page frame number that this entry points to.
4. Trie structure for page table - 5 levels, each with 512 indices of 64-bits. Our vpn is 45 bits, divided into 9-bit we get 5 groups of pt nodes. Each pt node occupy a physical frame of size 4 KB = 4096 bytes. Each a pte = page table entry in node is 64 bits.
